## Introduction

This project focuses on performance testing of the E-Service Center application using Apache JMeter. Performance testing helps in evaluating the system's behavior under different load conditions to ensure its stability and reliability.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Apache JMeter installed on your system. If not, download and install it from

- [Apache JMeter website](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi).

Download the E-Service Center project from the GitHub repository:

- [E-Service Center GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Humaira6/E-Service-Center)

Clone or download the project and set it up in your localhost environment to perform API testing.

## APIs Tested

- http://localhost/E-Service-Center/index.php
- http://localhost/E-Service-Center/Requester/RequesterLogin.php
- http://localhost/E-Service-Center/Requester/RequesterProfile.php
- http://localhost/E-Service-Center/Requester/SubmitRequest.php
- http://localhost/E-Service-Center/Requester/submitrequestsuccess.php
- http://localhost/E-Service-Center/logout.php

## Installation

1. Download the provided JMX file.
2. Open Apache JMeter.
3. Open the downloaded JMX file in Apache JMeter.

## Performance Testing Scenarios

### Load Testing

- Configure the test plan for 520 threads, ramp-up period of 10 seconds, and loop count of 1.
- Run the test plan to simulate the load with 520 users.

### Load Testing Variation

- Modify the test plan for 540 threads.
- Run the test plan to simulate the load with 540 users.

### Endurance Testing

- Modify the test plan for 540 threads and duration of 10 minutes.
- Run the test plan to simulate the endurance test with 540 users over a 10-minute period.

### Spike Testing

- Modify the test plan for 700 threads.
- Run the test plan to simulate the spike test with a sudden increase in load with 700 threads.

## Running the Test

- Click the "Run" button in Apache JMeter to start the test plan execution.
- Monitor the test results for response times, error rates, throughput, and other relevant metrics.

## Results Analysis

- Analyze the results generated by Apache JMeter to identify performance bottlenecks, errors, and areas for improvement.
- Use JMeter's built-in listeners and reporting tools to view and analyze test results.
  Results Attachment
  All the summary reports with different amount of threads. The summary report provides a summary of the total number of requests, average response time, error count etc for the entire test plan.

520 Threads

![520Threads](https://github.com/Humaira6/Performance-Testing-of-E-Service-Center/blob/main/SS/520Threads.PNG)

The summary reports shows the total number of requests which is 5720 and error rate is 0 % in this scenario.

560 threads

![560Threads](https://github.com/Humaira6/Performance-Testing-of-E-Service-Center/blob/main/SS/560Threads.PNG)

Here the attachment shows 6160 requests and the total error rate is 0.26% and the throughput is 40.9/sec.

580 Threads

![580Threads](https://github.com/Humaira6/Performance-Testing-of-E-Service-Center/blob/main/SS/580Threads.PNG)

In the above scenario the number of request is 6380 and with this the error rate is above one percent which is 1.82% so the system behavior with this amount of request is not so good.

700 threads

![700Threads](https://github.com/Humaira6/Performance-Testing-of-E-Service-Center/blob/main/SS/700Threads.PNG)

For spike testing I have loaded the system which a huge number of threads which is 700, in this scenario system behavior degrades and the error rate is 7.31%.

## Recommendations

- Adjust thread counts, ramp-up periods, and loop counts based on your application's requirements and expected usage patterns.
- Run multiple iterations of the tests to ensure consistency and reliability of the results.
- Consider running the tests on different environments (e.g., local, staging, production) to simulate real-world conditions.
